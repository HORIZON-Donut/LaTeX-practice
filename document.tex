which is approximately 68\% of GDP.
As of October 4, 2008, 
the ``Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008'' raised the current debt ceiling to \$11.3 trillion.

 - Math Notation example

Let $a$ and $b$ be distinc positive integer, and let $c = a + b$.

And let $y = x - c$ be \ldots

The roots of a quadratic equation are given by
\begin{equation}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation}
where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are \ldots

Let $X_1, X_2, X_3, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence od independent and identically distributed random variables 
with $E[X_i] = \mu$ and Var$[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
\begin{equation}
S_n = \frac{1}n\sum_{i=1}^n X_i
\end{equation}
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n (S_n - \mu)}$ converge in distribution
to a normal $N(0, \sigma)^2$.
